# Node Encryption

There are several options available for disk encryption in Linux:
* [[dm-crypt]] plain (without LUKS)
* cryptsetup with [[luks]] header (LUKS1/LUKS2)

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[dm-crypt]: dm-crypt "dm-crypt"
[luks]: luks "LUKS"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
